The "Bring Out Your Dead Factory" is deployed at **0xDEAD120FB5Aad12a3D3cAd140C66dad2A6739422** on the [Kovan Testnet](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xdead120fb5aad12a3d3cad140c66dad2a6739422) and the [Ethereum Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdead120fb5aad12a3d3cad140c66dad2a6739422).

The "Bring Out Your Dead" smart contract is your personal Estate on the blockchain and also serves as a Gnosis Safe Recovery Module.  The owner of an Estate can designate their beneficiaries and an executor.  If the owner ever loses their keys, their Gnosis Safe and Estate can be recovered with the help of the executor and beneficiaries, based on the owners preferences.  After the owners death, assets stored in the Estate and in your Gnosis Safe are easily distributed to the beneficiaries according to the wishes of the deceased.
